            <div class="border"></div>
            I have had a passion for cooking since my early childhood while growing up in Italy. I just loved to prepare
            and taste food with my mom in our small family kitchen. When I was a teen, I worked at local restaurants.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now I can boast 20 years of experience working as a chef at a top-rated restaurant in San Francisco. I have
            extensive expertise in professional catering events of any size, from birthday parties and baby showers to
            luxury weddings, corporate, and galas.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a big fan of various cuisines of the world and often experiment with my recipes.

            In 2001, I moved to New York to work in top restaurants. Since then, I have been serving private residences
            and many other venues with gourmet show-stopping food prepared with love.
            <br>
            <br>
            I pay great attention to the quality of the products from which I cook. I only buy groceries at farmers'
            markets. All the vegetables, fruits, and meats I use in my meals and traditional recipes are 100% organic,
            fresh, and of the highest quality.
            <br>
            <br>
            Together with my team, I create real culinary masterpieces available to everyone. I also create culinary
            pairings. Touch the haute cuisine in a modern design with me!
